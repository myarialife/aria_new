## 1. Introduction

ARIA is a decentralized AI personal assistant built on the Solana blockchain, aimed at addressing privacy protection and data sovereignty issues in the AI industry. This document details the economic model of the ARI token within the ARIA ecosystem, including token distribution, utilities, and incentive mechanisms.

### 1.1 Project Vision

The vision of the ARIA project is to create a user-friendly, privacy-first AI assistant that empowers users with complete control over their data through blockchain technology, while incentivizing all participants in the ecosystem through a token economic system.

### 1.2 Tokenomics Design Principles

ARIA's token economics follows these design principles:

- **Value Alignment**: Ensure token holders' interests align with the project's long-term success
- **Sustainability**: Design an economic model that can be maintained long-term
- **Fair Distribution**: Ensure fair token distribution among ecosystem participants
- **Practical Utility**: Tokens should have clear utility value, not just as speculative instruments
- **Incentive Compatibility**: Incentive mechanisms should encourage behaviors beneficial to the ecosystem

## 2. ARI Token Overview

### 2.1 Basic Information

- **Name**: ARIA Token
- **Symbol**: ARI
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Token Standard**: SPL Token
- **Decimals**: 9
- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000 ARI (100 million)
- **Initial Circulating Supply**: 15,000,000 ARI (15 million, 15% of total)

### 2.2 Token Functions

The ARI token is a core component of the ARIA ecosystem with the following functions:

1. **Access Rights**: Accessing ARIA's advanced features requires holding or staking ARI tokens
2. **Governance Rights**: Token holders can participate in DAO decision-making
3. **Incentives**: Users earn ARI tokens by contributing data and feedback
4. **Transaction Medium**: Transactions within the ecosystem are settled using ARI tokens
5. **Value Storage**: Tokens can capture value from ecosystem growth

## 3. Token Distribution

The total supply of 100,000,000 ARI will be distributed according to the following proportions:

| Category | Percentage | Amount | Locking/Release Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|------------|--------|--------------------------|---------|
| Community Incentives | 40% | 40,000,000 | Linear release over 4 years | User rewards, data contribution rewards, referral programs |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 15,000,000 | 6-month lock, then linear release over 24 months | Incentives for project team and advisors |
| Ecosystem Fund | 20% | 20,000,000 | Strategic release over 4 years | Ecosystem development, partnerships, marketing campaigns |
| Early Investors | 10% | 10,000,000 | 6-month lock, then linear release over 18 months | Early project funding support |
| Liquidity Pool | 10% | 10,000,000 | No lock | Ensure market liquidity |
| DAO Treasury | 5% | 5,000,000 | Determined by community governance | Long-term governance and strategic decision funding |

### 3.1 Initial Circulating Supply

Initial circulating supply will include:
- 10,000,000 ARI (10%) allocated to the liquidity pool
- 5,000,000 ARI (5%) from the first release of community incentives

Initial market cap and pricing will be based on principles of reasonable valuation and sustainable growth.

## 4. Token Use Cases and Utility

### 4.1 Product Access Rights

ARI tokens will be used for the following product access rights:

| Feature/Service | Pricing Model | Description |

- Algorithms ensure privacy and anonymity of shared data
- Businesses can use ARI tokens to purchase anonymized datasets

### 4.3 Governance and Voting

ARI holders can participate in the following governance decisions:

- Product roadmap and feature priorities
- Protocol parameter adjustments
- Ecosystem fund allocation
- Token economic model updates

Voting weight is proportional to the number of ARI tokens staked, using a quadratic voting mechanism to prevent whale manipulation.

## 5. User Incentive Mechanisms

### 5.1 Data Contribution Rewards

Users earn ARI tokens through the following means:

| Contribution Type | Reward Range | Quality Factor |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Conversation Data | 0.01-0.1 ARI/conversation | x0.5-x2.0 |
| Feedback and Ratings | 0.05-0.2 ARI/item | x0.5-x3.0 |
| Error Reports | 0.5-5.0 ARI/report | Based on severity |
| Expert Knowledge Contribution | 1.0-10.0 ARI/contribution | Based on value |

Reward calculation formula:
```
Reward = Base Reward × Quality Factor × Scarcity Coefficient
```

### 5.2 Community Contribution Rewards

| Contribution Type | Reward Method | Description |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Community Support | Community points + ARI | Helping other users solve problems |
| Content Creation | ARI based on impact | Creating tutorials, articles, etc. |
| Localization Support | ARI based on translation volume | Helping with global expansion |
| Code Contribution | ARI based on impact | Contributing code to open-source parts |

### 5.3 Referral Program

Users referring new users to the ARIA ecosystem will receive:

- First referral: 5 ARI
- When referred user remains active for 30 days: Additional 10 ARI
- When referred user purchases premium plan: 20% of subscription value as ARI reward

Multi-level referral program:
- Level 1 referral: 100% of rewards
- Level 2 referral: 20% of rewards
- Level 3 referral: 5% of rewards

### 5.4 Staking Rewards

Users staking ARI tokens will receive:

- Additional AI usage rights
- Governance voting rights
- Staking rewards (5-15% APY, based on staking duration)

| Q1 2029 | 100% | 15,000,000 | 100,000,000 |

### 6.3 Deflationary Mechanisms

To create a long-term sustainable token economic model, ARIA implements the following deflationary mechanisms:

- **Token Buyback**: 20% of platform revenue is used for market buyback of ARI
- **Token Burning**: 50% of bought-back tokens are permanently burned
- **Service Fee Burning**: 5% of platform usage fees are directly burned
- **Deflation Cap**: Total supply can be reduced to a minimum of 90 million ARI (10% cap)

## 7. Community Governance

### 7.1 DAO Structure

The ARIA DAO will launch 6 months after token release, with the following governance structure:

- **Core Contributors Committee**: 7 members, responsible for daily execution
- **Community Council**: 11 elected members, responsible for major decisions
- **Working Groups**: Focused on specific areas (product, market, finance, etc.)
- **All Token Holders**: Vote on proposals

### 7.2 Governance Weight

Governance voting rights are calculated based on the following factors:

```
Voting Power = √(Staked Token Amount) × Activity Coefficient
```

- **Staked Token Amount**: Number of ARI tokens staked by user
- **Activity Coefficient**: Calculated based on user activity, range 0.5-2.0

Quadratic voting mechanism ensures more decentralized decision-making.

### 7.3 Proposal Types

| Proposal Type | Required Support | Minimum Participation | Execution Timelock |
